## Geo Quiz Introduciton

This is the Geo Quiz app in the [Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003). Being the first app in the course it is fairly basic playing a recorded message in a certain language then displaying flags to the user so they can guess the correct language.

## Technologies Used

- AVSpeechSynthesizer -- Used to synthesize the voice for multi language recordings
- AVFoundation -- Used to play the synthesized voice to the user
- Tableviews -- Used to display the flags that the user gets to choose from
- MVC design -- Keep code simple ;)


## Installation

> **Set for a minimum deployment target of iOS 9.**
